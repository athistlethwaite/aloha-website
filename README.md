# Aloha Project

This project showcases the HTML, CSS & JavaScript skills learned in the first two weeks as part of the Web Development Program at RED Academy. The purpose of this project was to recreate the demonstrated website (a front-page), and ensure that it was responsive over a variety of viewing form-factors for an imaginary 'Hawaiian' clothing company. It taught how to build a reponsive website, and the importance of creating a mobile first design. 

After this project, we were taught more useful, efficient ways to building a website such as SASS, Flexbox, Grid, etc.
